Monad CAD 0.0.2 Design Specifications

Scope
This folder provides detailed specifications for the near-term design tasks identified in the 0.0.1 roadmap. These specs refine architectural abstractions into implementable contracts.

Contents
- TOPOLOGY_PATH.md: Stable topology path encoding and serialization.
- OPERATOR_DETERMINISM.md: Determinism contract and nondeterministic operator handling.
- IDENTITY_LIFECYCLE.md: Sub-entity identity rules and reference repair.
- STORAGE_FORMAT.md: Content-addressable storage and schema definitions.
- EVAL_ENGINE_API.md: DAG construction, dependency metadata, and cache policy.

Status
- Pre-implementation design phase.
- No runnable code; validation is by architectural review.
