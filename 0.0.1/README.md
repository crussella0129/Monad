Monad CAD 0.0.1 Architecture Baseline

Scope
This folder captures the initial architectural ground truth for Monad CAD. It is derived from the AI-Mem-Log v0 memo and formatted into discrete, durable references for future agents.

Principles
- Geometry is data, intent, and transformation context.
- Deterministic, explainable evaluation is mandatory.
- Imported geometry is first-class and must remain usable.
- Identity and references are explicit; failures are loud.
- Timeline is authoritative; tree mode is upstream synthesis.

Contents
- ARCHITECTURE.md: module boundaries and responsibilities.
- DATA_MODELS.md: core entities and invariants.
- EVALUATION.md: evaluation contract and dependency model.
- FAILURE_MODES.md: failure semantics and guardrails.
- HELLO_WORLD_FLOW.md: minimal conceptual flow.
- ROADMAP.md: near-term follow-on design tasks.
